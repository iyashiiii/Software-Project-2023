# software-project

-- Final Project in my current course: Software Design 
(took me 3 sleepless nights XD LOL, the feeling of accomplishment as a college student is amazing XD)

This is an application created for clothing store management using Python and MySQL.
(pip) install PIL (Pillow) library in the IDE.
Download db browser as well for the database record.

imports needed are:
-- tkinter
-- from PIL = Image and ImageTk
-- sqlite3  #for db browser database

Files:
-- main.py  
the maincode for everythinggg

-- admin.txt
For the login page. the admin should input the username and password of his/her employees.

-- data.db
This is the database file created, and will be accessed through the db browser.



P.S. - I apologize, this code is very rough, didn't have time to polish it or make it clean for the eyes. XD
